Cassandra


* 		Cassandra is written in Java.
* 		The topology of Cassandra includes several layers:
                * Node — the single deployed instance of Cassandra;
                * Rack — the collection of Cassandra’s instances grouped by some attribute and located in the same data center;
                * Datacenter — the combination of all Racks located in the same data center;
                * Cluster — the collection of all Datacenters.
* 		Cassandra uses an IP address to identify a node.
* 		Cassandra stores part of the data in RAM to speed up reading and writing.
